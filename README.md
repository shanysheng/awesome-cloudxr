## Architecture

### 1. GamingAnywhere: an open cloud gaming system 
**Authors**: Chun-Ying Huang1, Cheng-Hsin Hsu2, Yu-Chun Chang3,4, and Kuan-Ta Chen3

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
GamingAnywhere is an open-source clouding gaming platform. In addition to its openness, we design GamingAnywhere for high extensibility, portability, and reconfigurability. GamingAnywhere currently supports Windows and Linux, and can be ported to other OS's including OS X and Android. Table 1 gives the latest supported OS's and versions. Our performance study demonstrates that GamingAnywhere achieves high responsiveness and video quality yet imposes low network traffic. The value of GamingAnywhere, however, is from its openness: researchers, service providers, and gamers may customize GamingAnywhere to meet their needs. This is not possible in other closed and proprietary cloud gaming platforms.
