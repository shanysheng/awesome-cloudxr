<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
This thesis presents a fully functional remote streaming web-based 3D visualization application, that will enable any device to render interactive 3D graphics in real-time. The application only requires a web browser to work and is not limited by the hardware/software and the physical size of the used device. Our application takes advantage of real-time communication technologies, like WebRTC, and multimedia frameworks, like GStreamer, to stream 3D content through the web browser. We also study the performance limitations of native rendering 3D content on mobile devices, by evaluating the number of objects various mobile devices are capable of rendering, concluding that mobile devices are less adequate to render a high number of polygons. In our experiments, the server completed the rendering, on average, 10% faster than our most powerful smartphone, and rendered 46 300 more objects.

**Authors**: Chun-Ying Huang, Cheng-Hsin Hsu, Yu-Chun Chang, and Kuan-Ta Chen
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
GamingAnywhere is an open-source clouding gaming platform. In addition to its openness, we design GamingAnywhere for high extensibility, portability, and reconfigurability. GamingAnywhere currently supports Windows and Linux, and can be ported to other OS's including OS X and Android. Table 1 gives the latest supported OS's and versions. Our performance study demonstrates that GamingAnywhere achieves high responsiveness and video quality yet imposes low network traffic. The value of GamingAnywhere, however, is from its openness: researchers, service providers, and gamers may customize GamingAnywhere to meet their needs. This is not possible in other closed and proprietary cloud gaming platforms.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
While cloud gaming opens new business opportunity, it also poses tremendous challenges as the Internet only provides best-effort service and gamers are hard to please. Although researchers have various ideas to improve cloud gaming systems, existing cloud gaming systems are closed and proprietary, and cannot be used to evaluate these ideas. We present GamingAnywhere, the first open-source cloud gaming system, which is extensible, portable, and configurable. GamingAnywhere may be used by: (i) researchers and engineers to implement and test their new ideas, (ii) service providers to develop cloud gaming services, and (iii) gamers to set up private cloud gaming systems. Details on GamingAnywhere are given in this paper. We firmly believe GamingAnywhere will stimulate future studies on cloud gaming and real-time interactive distributed systems.

### 5. LiveRender: A Cloud Gaming System Based on Compressed Graphics Streaming
**Authors**: Li Lin Xiaofei Liao  Guang Tan Hai Jin Xiaobin Yang Wei Zhang Bo Li
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
In cloud gaming systems, the game program runs at servers in the cloud, while clients access game services by sending input events to the servers and receiving game scenes via video streaming. In this paradigm, servers are responsible for all performance-intensive operations, and thus suffer from poor scalability. An alternative paradigm is calledgraphics streaming, in which graphics commands and data are offloaded to the clients for local rendering, thereby mitigating the server's burden and allowing more concurrent game sessions. Unfortunately, this approach is bandwidth consuming, due to large amounts of graphic commands and geometry data. In this paper, we present LiveRender, an open source gaming system that remedies the problem by implementing a suite of bandwidth optimization techniques including intra-frame compression, inter-frame compression, and caching, establishing what we call compressed graphics streaming. Experiments results show that the new approach is able to reduce bandwidth consumption by 52-73% compared to raw graphics streaming, with no perceptible difference in video quality and reduced response delay. Compared with the video streaming approach, LiveRender achieves a traffic reduction of 40-90% with even improved video quality and substantially smaller response delay, while enabling higher concurrency at the server.

### 6. Nebula: Reliable Low-latency Video Transmission for Mobile Cloud Gaming
**Authors**: Ahmad Alhilal (1), Tristan Braud (1), Bo Han (2), Pan Hui (1) ((1) Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2) George Mason University)
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Mobile cloud gaming enables high-end games on constrained devices by streaming the game content from powerful servers through mobile networks. Mobile networks suffer from highly variable bandwidth, latency, and losses that affect the gaming experience. This paper introduces Nebula, an end-to-end cloud gaming framework to minimize the impact of network conditions on the user experience. Nebula relies on an end-to-end distortion model adapting the video source rate and the amount of frame-level redundancy based on the measured network conditions. As a result, it minimizes the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency while protecting the frames from losses. We fully implement Nebula and evaluate its performance against the state of the art techniques and latest research in realtime mobile cloud gaming transmission on a physical testbed over emulated and real wireless networks. Nebula consistently balances MTP latency (<140 ms) and visual quality (>31dB) even in highly variable environments. A user experiment confirms that Nebulamaximizes the user experience with high perceived video quality, playability, and low user load.

### 1. Cloud Pricing Models: Taxonomy, Survey, and Interdisciplinary Challenges
**Authors**: CAESAR WU, RAJKUMAR BUYYA, and KOTAGIRI RAMAMOHANARAO
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
This article provides a systematic review of cloud pricing in an interdisciplinary approach. It examines many historical cases of pricing in practice and tracks down multiple roots of pricing in research. The aim is to help both cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud customers to capture the essence of cloud pricing when they need to make a critical decision either to achieve competitive advantages or to manage cloud resource effectively. Currently, the number of available pricing schemes in the cloud market is overwhelming. It is an intricate issue to understand these schemes and associated pricing models clearly due to involving several domains of knowledge, such as cloud technologies, microeconomics, operations research, and value theory. Some earlier studies have introduced this topic unsystematically. Their approaches inevitably lead to much confusion for many cloud decision-makers. To address their weaknesses, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud pricing, which is driven by a framework of three fundamental pricing strategies that are built on nine cloud pricing categories. These categories can be further mapped onto a total of 60 pricing models. Many of the pricing models have been already adopted by CSPs. Others have been widespread across in other industries. We give descriptions of these model categories and highlight both advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, this article offers an extensive survey of many cloud pricing models that were proposed by many researchers during the past decade. Based on the survey, we identify four trends of cloud pricing and the general direction, which is moving from intrinsic value per physical box to extrinsic value per serverless sandbox. We conclude that hyper-converged cloud resources pool supported by cloud orchestration, virtual machine, Open Application Programming Interface, and serverless sandbox will drive the future of cloud pricing.

### 1. A Cost-Efficient Cloud Gaming System at Scale
**Authors**: 
<details span> Yiling Xu; Qiu Shen; Xin Li; Zhan Ma
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
This article proposes a transparent gaming (TG) cloud system that allows users to play any popular high-end desktop game on the fly over the Internet. Toward this goal, we have introduced the TG-SHARE technology to share the underlying hardware capabilities, particularly for the GPU and the dedicated compression acceleration unit (XCODER). TG-SHARE utilizes offthe- shelf consumer GPUs without resorting to expensive proprietary GPU virtualization technology (e.g., GRID from NVIDIA). XCODER adapts the compression based on the network dynamics, learned gaming behaviors, and hardware resources to significantly reduce bandwidth consumption. Google's webRTC protocol is integrated to offer real-time interaction and ubiquitous access from heterogeneous devices. Compared to the existing cloud gaming vendor using the GRID technology, our TG-SHARE not only reduces the expense per user (i.e., 75 percent hardware cost reduction, 20-40 percent network cost reduction), but also improves the quality of experience with higher rate of frames per second (i.e., 2 x FPS).

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Online gaming connects players from all over the world together for fun and entertainment, and has been regarded as one of the most profitable and popular Internet services. Besides, there is a growing trend towards moving local applications to remote data centers: this is often referred to as the cloud. With the purpose of studying the impact of Cloud Gaming on the access network load, in this paper we carry out an empirical network traffic analysis of two well-known cloud gaming platforms: On-Live and Gaikai. Traffic traces have been collected and analysed from five different games of both platforms. Cloud gaming has been observed to be remarkably different from traditional online gaming in terms of network load and traffic characteristics. Moreover, the traces have revealed similarities between the two platforms regarding the packet size distribution, and differences concerning the packet inter-arrival times. However, each platform shows a similar traffic pattern for most of the games it serves. Nonetheless, the racing and shooter games considered in this work demand more bandwidth than other game-genres.

### 3. Are all games equally cloud-gaming-friendly?: an electromyographic approach
**Authors**: 
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Cloud gaming now makes any computer game playable on a thin client without the previous worries and frustrations about the hardware requirements. It frees players from the need to frequently upgrade their computers as they can now play games that are hosted on remote servers with a broadband Internet connection and a thin client. However, cloud games are intrinsically more susceptible to latency than online games because game graphics are rendered on cloud servers and thin clients do not possess game state information that is required by delay compensation techniques. In this paper, we investigate how the response latency in cloud gaming would affect users' experience and how the impact of latency on players' experience varies among different games. We show that not all games are equally friendly to cloud gaming. That is, the same degree of latency may have very different impacts on a game's quality of experience depending on the game's real-time strictness. We thus develop a model that can predict a game's real-time strictness based on the rate of players' inputs and the game screen dynamics. The model can be used to simultaneously enhance players' gaming experience and optimize the operation cost of data centers.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
In this paper, we set out to 'demystify' cloud-based videogaming andits legal implications. We do this in two stages. First, we offer adescriptive analysis of the videogame sector, including relevantmarkets and supply chains. We explain the basics of cloud computingtechnology, traditional videogame technology, and how the twoconverge in cloud-based videogame ecosystems. We also analyzemarket structures for both the cloud and video game industries, aswell as relevant supply chains, in order to understand how thesemarkets will overlap. Based on these analyses, we make predictionsabout how the cloud gaming market will be structured, including abreakdown of three separate models for cloud gaming services: the'layered' model of Gaming-as-a-Service ('GaaS'), the 'integrated'model of GaaS, and the 'consumer infrastructure-as-a-service' model.Finally, we use these three models to analyze how certain intellectualproperty rights, contractual rights, and regulatory issues will developin this novel environment for videogame distribution and access.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
How will cloud gaming platforms affect the future progression of the video game industry? Inthis thesis, I analyze how the implementation and further progression of cloud gaming platformswill affect the video game industry in the future, through exploratory research. By using deskresearch and historical data, this thesis aims to express the reshaping that the video gameindustry has been through from its invention to its current state, as well as its future prospects.Based on the framework of Porter's five forces and Suarez' battle for technological dominance, Ihave used a combination of both frameworks firstly to analyze the current state of the videogame industry, as well as, the changes that will occur with the implementation of cloud gamingplatforms. Secondly, the framework is then used to analyze how the different cloud technology,and the companies behind them, compete throughout its lifecycle to gain dominance in theindustry. Porter's five forces gives me the indication that the threat level in the industry willremain the same after the implementation of cloud gaming platforms. While Suarez' battle fortechnological dominance shows that cloud gaming platforms are still in a too early phase toaccurately gauge where it is headed. Aside from these two frameworks, there have also beenconducted semi-structured expert interviews with software developers to get a better grasp ofhow the industry is reaction to cloud gaming platforms. By using the results of these frameworksand the expert interviews, I will then discuss three possible scenarios that could be the futureoutcome of cloud gaming platforms. A key finding in the study indicates that cloud gamingplatforms have a promising future ahead where more companies are investing into them. Thisthesis contributes to existing literature by providing an overview of the current state and anoutline of future prospect for cloud gaming platforms.

### 7. CloudyGame: Enabling cloud gaming on the edge with dynamic asset streaming and shared game instances
**Authors**: A. Bhojan, Siang Ping Ng, J. Ng, Wei Tsang Ooi
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Cloud gaming has emerged as a new computer game delivery paradigm that promises gaming anywhere, anytime, on any device, by running the computer game on a cloud server and streaming the rendered frames to users. To fulfill its promises, a cloud gaming provider must face three main challenges: reducing the interaction latency, reducing the cloud infrastructure cost, and reducing the network bandwidth demand. One way to reduce interaction latency is to run the game on the edge instead of the cloud. This introduces two additional challenges due to the limited resources available on the edge servers. First, there is a high initialization cost to install a game on the edge server if the game that a player wishes to play is not already installed. Second, an edge server typically has limited computing resources compared to the servers in the cloud. In this work, we address these two issues by proposing CloudyGame, a new software architecture for developing computer games, in which (i) resources are more efficiently shared and managed between different playing instances, and (ii) game assets are streamed on-demand to reduce the initialization cost. CloudyGame is implemented with a popular game engine, and thus any game built on the engine supports CloudyGame out of the box. Our evaluation shows that a game running on CloudyGame architecture needs 70‚Äì80% less RAM, VRAM, and CPU than a game using conventional architecture when running with four players. Furthermore, the game asset streaming system reduces the game's initial loading time by 70%. Hence, our cloud gaming architecture is highly scalable and economically deployable to the edge. Further, due to a reduction in resource usage, the CloudyGame architecture would benefit games running in the cloud as well.

### 8. Edge Gaming: A Greening Perspective
**Authors**: Francesco Spinellia,b,‚àó, Antonio Bazco-Noguerasa, Vincenzo Mancusoa
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
We tackle the problem of how to support gaming at the edge of the cellular network. The reduced latency and higher bandwidth that the edge enjoys with respect to cloud-based solutions implies that transferring cloud-based games to the edge could be a premium service for end-users. The goal of this work is to design a scheme compatible with MEC and network slicing principles of 5G and beyond, and which maximizes the utility of a service/infrastructure provider with time-varying edge node capacities due to the access to intermittent renewable energy. We formulate a multi -dimensional integer linear programming problem, proving that it is NP-hard in the strong sense. We prove that our problem is sub-modular and propose an efficient heuristic, GREENING, which considers the allocation of gaming sessions and their migration. For the mentioned scenario, we analyze a wide variety of realistic configurations at the edge, studying how the performance depends on i) whether the games have a static or dynamic workload, ii) the distribution of renewable energy through nodes and time, or iii) the topology of the edge network. Through simulations, we show that our heuristic achieves performance close to that achieved by solving the NP-hard optimization problem, except with extremely lower complexity, and performs up to 25% better than state-of-the-art algorithms.

### 9. Rendering Server Allocation for MMORPG Players in Cloud Gaming
**Authors**: Iryanto Jaya, PictureWentong Cai, PictureYusen Li
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Cloud gaming services enable users with heterogeneous device capabilities to get access to game titles with hardware demanding specifications. While visual quality requirements are to be satisfied by the cloud rendering servers, latency is one of the major problems which arises as most of the tasks are offloaded remotely. Cloud gaming players must experience latency below a certain acceptable limit for the game to be responsive with playable visual quality under limited bandwidth capacity. Playing multiplayer games in the cloud needs to cater for player interactions and their commonality especially if they are playing in the same virtual space. The main characteristic of cloud gaming is that the whole rendering pipeline occurs in the cloud; therefore, rendering optimization by reusing common information across players is possible by taking advantage of multi-view rendering. In this paper, we propose a cloud gaming architecture for MMORPGs which involves hundreds of players as well as online optimization heuristic algorithms on rendering server allocations in order to minimize rendering server rental cost from game provider's point of view. In addition, we also compare the performance of those online heuristics with an offline lower bound in order to observe the scalability of the online scenario.

### 10. The Future of Cloud Gaming [Point of View]
**Authors**: Wei Cai, R. Shea, Chun-Ying Huang, Kuan-Ta Chen, Jiangchuan Liu, Victor C. M. Leung, Cheng-Hsin Hsu
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
In the late 2000s, several startups including OnLive [7] and GaiKai [8] started to offer cloud gaming services. Cloud gaming, as illustrated in Fig. 1, refers to the technologies that offload parts of game software from traditional game consoles or personal computers (PCs) to powerful and elastic cloud infrastructures. Cloud gaming makes perfect sense to: 1) gamers, who otherwise have to constantly upgrade their consoles or PCs, which is certainly no fun and costly; 2) cloud service providers, who can sell the already-deployed and idling cloud resources to support the cutting-edge games that are extremely resource hungry; and 3) game developers, who no longer need to spend months to port their games to different platforms. As such, cloud gaming has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. Initially, given the limited scales of these startups, people were not sure whether cloud gaming could be commercially successful. A fundamental question that came to people, inside and outside the gaming circle, was: Will the three dominating console manufacturers, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, be willing to give up their margin of selling the game consoles? The answer was initially unclear, and many suspected that these console manufacturers would be more than happy to kill cloud gaming in order to remain profitable. The opposite actually happened: Sony acquired GaiKai in 2012 for $380 million, announced the new service PlayStation Now (PS Now) in early 2014, and brought PS Now to parts of the world in 2015. Using PS Now, Sony allows their customers to play hundreds of PlayStation 3 (PS3) games on the latest PlayStation 4 (PS4) consoles without porting the games. Sony has also unveiled a plan to: 1) allow gamers to use other PlayStation consoles and smart TV to access PS Now; and 2) include game titles developed for other generations of PlayStations on PS Now. The emerging PS Now service indicates that cloud gaming has great potential to become the next-generation, universal computer gaming platform. Offering high-quality cloud gaming experience with the remote cloud through the public Internet, however, is no easy task. Current cloud gaming services have leveraged real-time video streaming technologies that have a long history of development. They share certain common characteristics, including high bandwidth demand and real-time constraints. Yet the demands of gaming are often higher than live or on-demand video streaming. Certain cloud gaming services dictate a network bandwidth of about 5 Mb/s for smooth gaming experience, which Corresponding author: Jiangchuan Liu (e-mail: jcliu@sfu.ca).

 ### 11. The Server Allocation Problem for Session-Based Multiplayer Cloud Gaming
**Authors**: Yunhua Deng, Yusen Li, Ronald Seet, Xueyan Tang, Wentong Cai
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Advances in cloud computing and GPU virtualization are allowing the game industry to move into a cloud gaming era. In this paper, we consider multiplayer cloud gaming (MCG), which is the natural integration of multiplayer online gaming and cloud gaming paradigms. With MCG, a game server and a set of rendering servers for the players need to be located and launched in the clouds for each game session. We formulate an MCG server allocation problem with the objective of minimizing the total server rental and bandwidth cost charged by the cloud to support an MCG session. The MCG server allocation problem is hard to solve optimally. We propose several efficient heuristics to address the problem and carry out theoretical analysis for the proposed hill-climbing algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments using real Internet latency and cloud pricing datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as several alternatives. Experimental results show that our best algorithm can achieve near-optimal cost under real-time latency constraints.
